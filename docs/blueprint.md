## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated light-to-mid-tone blue (#87AFC7) reminiscent of a clear sky. Blue can imply trustworthiness and professionalism, and its calming effect makes it highly appropriate for a portfolio site.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F4F8), close in hue to the primary, for a clean, light theme.
- Accent color: Light-to-mid-tone green (#96CA8D). It's analogous to the blue, and adds a hint of freshness and vitality. The specific hue is far enough to the 'left' to offer appropriate contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Lucide icons will be used throughout the website for a consistent and clean aesthetic.
- Clean, minimalist layout with plenty of white space to allow the photographs to stand out. Use of Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually appealing design.
